# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
<!-- --- -->

## Project Description
---

In this project, I have applied my Python skills to solve a real-world data science problem. I discovered if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I have also gained experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data.

## This Projects solves the following tasks:
1. _**Loading the Netflix data into a dictionary**_
2. _**Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary**_
3. _**A visual inspection of our data**_
4. _**Loading the rest of the data from a CSV**_
5. _**Filtering for movies!**_
6. _**Creating a scatter plot**_
7. _**Digging deeper**_
8. _**Marking non-feature films**_
9. _**Plotting with color!**_
10. _**What next?**_

### The Jupyter notebook contains the answer (code) for all of the above tasks:
