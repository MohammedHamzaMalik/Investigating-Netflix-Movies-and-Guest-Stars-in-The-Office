# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office

### Project Description
In this project, I have applied the Python skills to solve a real-world data science problem. I discovered if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

I have also gained experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This allowed me to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data.
